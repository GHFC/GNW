Quick description :
* Conditioning/SimpleConditioning : Testing the second experiment in Izhikevich's 2007 paper.
* MultiColumns/GNW : Architecture for the Global Neuronal Workspace
* MultiColumns/Digits : Sandbox for MNIST digits recognition
* ReinforceSynapse/ReinforceSynapse : Testing the first experiment in Izhikevich's 2007 paper. In a large network of neurons, we artificially release dopamine when the synapse between neurons 0 and 1 is activated. The goal is to check that this synapse actually reinforces itself.
* SynapseModel/STDP_Reward : Izhikevich's synapse model
* XOR/XOR : Sandbox for XOR function
